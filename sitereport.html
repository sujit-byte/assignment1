                <h3>My Web Development Journey</h3>
<p>
    When I started this module, I didn’t know much about web development. HTML and CSS seemed a bit hard at first, but later I found them fun and interesting. I began with simple things and slowly learned how to make full web pages. Sometimes things didn’t work, which was a bit frustrating, but I learned how to fix them. Making the website look good on both desktop and mobile was tricky, but it felt great when it finally worked.
</p>
<p>
     During the term, I wrote down what I learned and what was hard. Some days were tricky, but with practice , I improved myself. I enjoyed testing new layouts and animations, and it was fun to see my website come to life. This module helped me learn more about developing consistent webpages that worked in both mobile and desktop and feel myself more confident. Moreover. this module helps me to build my skills as well as confidence..
</p>

<h3> Module Experience</h3>
<p>
    This module helped me learn the basics of web development. It had both lessons and practice, which I liked. The assignments pushed me to try new things and get better. Working with classmates and my teacher’s feedback helped me improve. I learned how important it is to write clean code and follow rules so websites work well for everyone.
</p>

<h3>Design Decisions</h3>
<p>
   I choosed soft colors like light gray for the background and dark gray for the text and header because they look nice and are easy to read. The font is simple and doesn’t have extra decorations, but so the text is clear on any device. I also used hover effects in my nav bar. I wanted my website good and professional, so I chose colors and fonts that look good together without being too bright or busy.
